This repository contains one primary file dpll_solver.py which is a python-bas\
ed
implementation of a SAT solver that uses the DPLL algorithm. The solver
implements cascading unit propagation and allows several variable ordering
heuristics to be used based on command-line flags.

The repository also includes some test SAT problems in DIMACS CNF format.

Example usage:

python dpll_solver.py FILE=testdata/problem1.cnf
